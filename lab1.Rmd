##Exercise 1: For x = 2 and y = 8, compute the sum, difference, product and quotient of x and y
x= 2
y = 8
x+y
x-y
x*y
x/y
```

##Exercise 2 For x = 3.5 and y = 5, Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value
x = 3.5
y = 5
x^5>y^4

#Exercise 3 Create a vector of the values 211, 62, 108, 43 and 129. Determine the sum of the vector. Divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine relate frequency.
num_vec<- c(211, 62, 108, 43, 129)
sum(num_vec)
```

#Exercise 4 Create a vector of the nucleotides A, T, C and G. Sort the vector.
nuc_vec<- c("A", "T", "C", "G")
sort(nuc_vec)
